## ü¶ï ReAct prompting
These Large Language Models (LLM) can combine reasoning and action. These models are often used for reasoning or for acting. But they are not always effectively used for both at the same time. CoT prompting shows promise for an LLM to reason and generate actions for straightforward tasks, like mathematics. However, the inability to update information or access external contents with CoT prompting can lead to errors in the output, such as fact hallucination. With a ReAct framework, LLMs can generate both reasoning traces and task specific actions that are based on external tools, such as Wikipedia pages or SQL databases. This external context leads to more accurate and reliable output
